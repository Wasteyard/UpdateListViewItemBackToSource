# UpdateListViewItemBackToSource
2017/06/30

Yesterday, when me just try to change a list of string, me create a style of **ListView**, which re-defines a kind of **ListViewItem** with a **TextBox** and a **Button**.

However, when me change the *Text* of the **TextBox**, the *ItemSource* of the **ListView** does not change a bit;

So, me think, should find a way to do this, that is this project, and it's useless, in fact, because here is my wasteyard, nothing useful here.
